My name is Kevin H. Wilson, and I'm the Associate Director and Head of Data Science at [The Policy Lab](https://thepolicylab.brown.edu). Once upon a time, I got a Ph.D. in math from Princeton, but since then I've worked at [Knewton](https://www.knewton.com/) building models for large scale education technology and at [The Lab @ DC](https://thelab.dc.gov/) helping build out a data science practice inside of state government.

I have a general interest in how we can improve educational access and technology, and more generally, how we can bring better data and software engineering practices to bear on policy disucssions. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/khayeswilson) and see some example projects I've worked on [here](/projects).
